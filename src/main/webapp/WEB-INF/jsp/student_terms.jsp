					 	<li>GR.3: Students must not abuse or otherwise interfere with any University System Staff in any manner which contributes to disrupting their work, or contribute in an intimidating, hostile or demeaning manner. In particular, Students may not contribute any intimidating or hostile comments in relation to any University System Stakeholder's occupation, opinions, race, gender, beliefs or sexual orientation.</li>
					 	<li>GR.4: Assignments and all other academic submissions for assessment must be a Student's own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration). Students must not plagiarise or engage in any other form of academic dishonesty.</li>

						<li>Students may not allow fellow students, friends, family members, or any other individuals to complete their academic work on their behalf.</li>
